# Derby County Data Task
GitHub reppository for the Derby County data task and analysis by [Edd Webster](https://twitter.com/eddwebster)

Within the notebooks repository, analysis is split in the following sections:
- <b>A) Data Parsing / Web Scraping</b> - acquisition of data from TransferMarkt
- <b>B) Data Engineering</b> - engineering of the data from 21st Club and fuzzy matching of 21st Club and TransferMarkt datasets

The final data sources exported for use in Tableau can be found in the data/export folder. The data is in both wide and long format as the different types were required for different visualisations.

Please see [public.tableau.com/profile/edd.webster/](https://public.tableau.com/profile/edd.webster/) and the dashboard titled 'Derby County EFL Data Analysis' for all the dashboards used in this analysis.
